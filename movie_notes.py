#### Notes #####
    
# The __init__ function creates things for class Movie to remember such as
# title, storyline, poster, and trailer.

# The keyword self is the object or instance being created.
# In this case, self is evil_within_2 

# Remember, parameters and arguments are not the same:
        # A parameter = the declaration of a function (ie. def sum(a,b)).
        # An argument = the actual value passed onto a function
        #(ie. def __init__(self, game_title, game_summary))

# An instance variable are unique variables attached to classes:
# For example, "title = 'Evil Within 2'"

# An instance method is a function defined inside a class and associated within
# an instance. For example, "show_trailer()".

# Despite what I believed, arrays and lists are not the same thing in Python. 99%
# of the time, I will use lists because they're flexible.

# Constant variables like "VALID_RATINGS" are all capitalized.

# The __doc__ keyword gives information on the class you're using, for example
# using "turtle.Turtle.__doc__" explains what the class Turtle does in Python.

# For the media.py code, we're using triple quotes(""") below class Movie() to
# cocaconate it to __doc__ so when we type out "media.Movie.__doc__", we get
# documentation as to what media.py does.
